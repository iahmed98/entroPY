# entroPY
Just a little something I made to make my homework easier by calculating entropy, a principal foundation for the decision tree.

## Usage
Load a CSV of your choice on line 71. Specify a target feature on line 72, and a method of calculation (entropy/gini) on line 76. This program as-is will give the first two splits for your decision tree.
